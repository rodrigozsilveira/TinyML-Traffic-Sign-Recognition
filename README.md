# Traffic Sign Detection with TinyML

This project presents a low-cost embedded system designed to **detect the presence of traffic signs in images** using TinyML techniques.

## Hardware

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense  
- CMOS OV7675 Camera  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model was trained on a **public dataset from Kaggle**, modified to include both images with and without signs, ensuring class balance and quality control.  
Main dataset: [Road Sign Detection â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection)

> **Developed at UNIFEI â€“ IESTI | 2025**
